      "**Top Priority**: If the `Correct Answer` indicates that no answer exists (e.g., it is empty, or states 'no solution' or 'undefined'), but the `Response to Evaluate` provides a numerical answer, this is a fundamental failure. In this case, you MUST report **only one error** stating this fact and then stop your analysis. As for location and deletion instructions, enter 'The entire response' to make thigns shorter.\n",

      "2.  **Logical Validity**: The steps and reasoning used to reach the conclusion must be mathematically sound. A correct answer achieved through flawed logic is still an error.\n",
      "3.  **Grammatical Clarity**: The explanation must be written in clear, grammatically correct language.\n",

      "2. `error_location`: The exact substring from the `Response to Evaluate` that contains the error.\n",
      "3. `error_correction`: A clear, actionable plan using `DELETE:` and `ADD:` commands to fix the error.\n",
      "   - **Word Integrity**: All `DELETE` operations must apply to whole words or numbers. Do not delete parts of words.\n",

      "1. **<DEL_W> (Delete Word)**: Deletes the single word or number immediately preceding it. Punctuation is part of the word (e.g., '25.').\n",

If only a word, number or operator is wrong, use `<DEL_W>`. Devise the most efficient correction that results in a valid mathematical derivation of the `Correct Answer`.\n",
