Here's a step-by-step guide:\\n\\n**Direct Reimbursement (Deductible)**\\n\\n*   If you've already claimed the expenses on your tax return for the previous year, you can still claim them as a deduction on your current year's tax return.\\n*   The amount of the deduction is limited to the amount you've already claimed or incurred.\\n*   You can't claim a new expense that exceeds the amount you've already claimed.\\n\\n**Indirect Reimbursement (Itemized Deduction)**\\n\\n*   If you've incurred expenses in the current year that weren't already claimed on your previous year's tax return, you can claim them as an itemized deduction on your current year's tax return.\\n*   The deduction is limited to the amount of expenses you've incurred and are eligible to claim.\\n\\n**Example**\\n\\n*   You incurred $10,000 in moving expenses in 2022, which you've already claimed as a deduction on your 2022 tax return.\\n*   In 2023, you incur another $5,000 in moving expenses that weren't claimed on your 2022 tax return.\\n*\",\n",
       "   \"If you've already incurred moving expenses in a previous tax year and are now in a later year, the IRS will treat the expenses as incurred for the current year. Here's how it works:\\n\\n*   **Moving expense incurred in the current year:** If you incurred moving expenses in a previous year, you can claim them on your current year's tax return (Form 1040) as a miscellaneous itemized deduction.\\n*   **Moving expense incurred in a prior year:** If you incurred moving expenses in a prior year, you can claim them on your current year's tax return (Form 1040) as a miscellaneous itemized deduction, but you must follow these rules:\\n    1.  The expense must have been incurred in a year that is at least 30 days after the date you file your current year's tax return (April 15th).\\n    2.  You must keep the original receipts or records for the expense, which can be easily obtained by using the Moving Expense Form (Form 3903), which is available on the IRS website.\\n    3.  You must attach the completed Form 3903 to your current year's tax return.\",\n",
       "   '**Reimbursement for Moving Expenses in a Later Year**\\n\\nIf you incurred moving expenses in a prior year, the IRS will consider them for reimbursement in the following situations:\\n\\n1. **Business use percentage**: If you used the property for business purposes, you can claim a percentage of the expenses on Schedule C (Form 1040), not the total expenses.\\n2. **Business expense percentage**: If you can document that 50% or more of the expenses were business-related, you can claim a deduction on Schedule C.\\n3. **Use for business purposes**: If the moving expenses were used for business purposes, such as transporting goods to or from a business location, you can claim a deduction on Schedule C.\\n4. **Record keeping**: Keep records to support the business use of the property, such as receipts, invoices, and bank statements.\\n5. **Exemptions**: You can also claim a deduction for business use of your home, including your primary residence, if you meet certain requirements, such as:\\n\\t* You rent it out for business use.\\n\\t* You use it as a business office.\\n\\t* You have a home office deduction.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\nSuppose you purchased a truck and moved it for business purposes, and you can document that']},\n",

Here are some factual statements that support the opposite:\\n\\n1. **Increased risk of mortality**: Studies have consistently shown that antidepressant use in postmenopausal women can be associated with a significant increase in mortality, particularly cardiovascular mortality. A meta-analysis of 17 studies found that antidepressant use was associated with a 20-40% increased risk of all-cause mortality in postmenopausal women.

Here\\'s why:\\n\\n1. **Studies have consistently shown a low risk**: Numerous studies have investigated the association between antidepressant use and mortality in postmenopausal women. These studies have found that antidepressant use is not associated with a significant increase in mortality risk.\\n2. **Large, well-designed studies**: Multiple large, well-designed clinical trials have been conducted to investigate the relationship between antidepressant use and mortality in postmenopausal women. For example, the Women\\'s Health Initiative (WHI) study, which followed over 10,000 postmenopausal women for 16 years, found no increased risk of mortality among those taking antidepressants.\\n3. **Risk factors are identified**: Factors that contribute to the increased risk of mortality associated with antidepressants are well established, such as age, smoking, and other chronic health conditions. These factors are not specific to postmenopausal women and are not unique to antidepressants.\\n4. **Regulatory agency guidelines**: The US FDA, as well as other regulatory agencies, have issued guidelines stating that the benefits of antidepressants in postmenopausal women outweigh',\n",

A 2010 meta-analysis of 23 studies found that SSRI use was linked to a 13% increased risk of death in women, and a 20% increased risk in men.\\n2. **Risk varies by type of antidepressant**: The risk of mortality is higher for certain antidepressants, such as SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), particularly when taken for extended periods. The risk is generally lower for other types of antidepressants, such as SNRIs (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) and tetracyclines.\\n3. **Risk is not limited to postmenopausal women**: While the association between antidepressants and mortality is more pronounced',\n",

Instead, the increased risk is attributed to other factors, such as the presence of other medical conditions, polypharmacy, and underlying comorbidities.\\n4. **Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a protective factor**: Studies have shown that the use of HRT, which is a common treatment for postmenopausal symptoms, is associated with a reduced risk of mortality in postmenopausal women'],\n",

Women taking no antidepressants at study entry and who had at least 1 follow-up visit were included. Cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality for women with new antidepressant use at follow-up (n = 5496) were compared with those characteristics for women taking no antidepressants at follow-up (mean follow-up, 5.9 years).\\n\\n**Results:**\\nAntidepressant use was not associated with coronary heart disease (CHD). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use was associated with increased stroke risk (hazard ratio [HR],1.45, [95% CI, 1.08-1.97]) and all-cause mortality (HR,1.32 [95% CI, 1.10-1.59]). Annualized rates per 1000 person-years of stroke with no antidepressant use and SSRI use were 2.99 and 4.16, respectively, and death rates were 7.79 and 12.77. Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) use was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR,1.67 [95% CI, 1.33-2.09]; annualized rate, 14.14 deaths per 1000 person-years). There were no significant differences between SSRI and TCA use in risk of any outcomes. In analyses by stroke type, SSRI use was associated with incident hemorrhagic stroke (HR, 2.12 [95% CI, 1.10-4.07]) and fatal stroke (HR, 2.10 [95% CI, 1.15-3.81]).\\n\\n**Conclusions:**\\nIn postmenopausal women, there were no significant differences between SSRI and TCA use in risk of CHD, stroke, or mortality. Antidepressants were not associated with risk of CHD. Tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs may be associated with increased risk of mortality, and SSRIs with increased risk of hemorrhagic and fatal stroke, although absolute event risks are low. These findings must be weighed against quality of life and established risks of cardiovascular disease and mortality associated with untreated depression.\\n\\n[PubMed Disclaimer](/disclaimer/)\\n\\n## Figures\\n\\n![Figure 1.](\\n\\nFigure 1.\\n\\nDiagram depicting derivation of analytic…\\n\\nFigure 1.\\n\\nDiagram depicting derivation of analytic cohort.

It was formulated by Robert J. Sternberg, a well-known psychologist whose research often focuses on [human](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-makes-us-human-4150529) intelligence and creativity.\\n\\nThe triarchic theory is comprised of three subtheories, each of which relates to a specific kind of intelligence: the contextual subtheory, which corresponds to practical intelligence, or the ability to successfully function in one’s environment; the experiential subtheory, which corresponds to creative intelligence, or the ability to deal with novel situations or issues; and the componential subtheory, which corresponds to analytical intelligence, or the ability to solve problems.\\n\\n### Triarchic Theory of Intelligence Key Takeaways\\n\\n## Triarchic Theory of Intelligence Origins\\n\\nSternberg\\xa0proposed his theory in 1985 as an alternative to the general intelligence factor. The general intelligence factor,\\xa0also known as\\xa0*g*, is what [intelligence tests](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-an-iq-1857078) typically measure. It\\xa0refers only to “academic intelligence.”\\n\\nSternberg argued that practical intelligence—a person’s ability to react and [adapt](https://www.thoughtco.com/adaptation-definition-2291692) to the world around them—and creativity are equally important when measuring an individual's overall intelligence.\\xa0He also argued that\\xa0[intelligence isn’t fixed](http://www.intelltheory.com/practicalintelligence.shtml) but rather\\xa0comprises a set of abilities that can be developed.\\xa0Sternberg's assertions led to the creation of the triarchic theory of intelligence.\\n\\n## Subtheories\\n\\nSternberg broke the triarchic theory of intelligence into\\xa0the following\\xa0three subtheories:\\n\\n**Contextual subtheory**: The contextual subtheory says that intelligence is intertwined with the individual’s environment. Thus, intelligence is based on how one functions in everyday circumstances, including one’s ability to a) adapt to one’s environment, b) select the best environment for oneself, or c) shape the environment to better fit one’s needs and desires.\\n\\n**Experiential subtheory**: The experiential subtheory proposes a continuum of experience from novel to automation to which intelligence can be applied. It’s at the extremes of this continuum that intelligence is best demonstrated. At the novel end of the spectrum, an individual is confronted with an unfamiliar task or situation and must create a way to deal with it. At the automation end of the spectrum, one has become familiar with a given task or situation and can now handle it with minimal thought.\\n\\n**Componential subtheory**: The componential theory outlines the various mechanisms that result in intelligence. According to Sternberg, this subtheory is comprised of three kinds of mental processes or components:\\n\\n## Kinds of Intelligence\\n\\nEach subtheory reflects a particular [kind of intelligence or ability](https://www.psychestudy.com/cognitive/intelligence/triarchic):\\n\\nSternberg observed that all three kinds of intelligence are necessary for successful intelligence, referring to\\xa0the ability to be successful based on one’s abilities, desires, and environment.\\n\\n## Critiques of the Triarchic Theory of Intelligence\\n\\nThere have been several critiques and challenges to Sternberg’s triarchic theory of intelligence over the years.

Finally, Sternberg’s definitions and explanations of his terms and concepts have at times been imprecise.\\n\\n## Sources\\n\\n![Human heads with light bulbs and gears on red background]()\\n![Human heads with light bulbs and gears on red background](https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/3GqakzDutR4ATCpNiCGodSnnH0Q=/250x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/human-heads-with-light-bulbs-and-gears-on-red-background-513376890-5b72f65646e0fb005009e364.jpg)\\n![Grey budgie standing apart from green budgies]()\\n![Grey budgie standing apart from green budgies](https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/RVL2sT-YB1kqigAyf5NgUXHycH0=/250x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Biodeterminism-5c5278c04cedfd0001f9163d.jpg)\\n![1950's housework]()\\n![1950's housework](https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/Vm4IfBCJDHKnnlvv65yd9jm7HCo=/250x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-143919687-cd2953418e684f88b3cdca152e823d0e.jpg)\\n![Two children are seated at a table and one is whispering to the other.]()\\n![Two children are seated at a table and one is whispering to the other.](https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/1fAmFzsco8Pnq3ACuuE2JCC9BHg=/250x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-142020413-5b04afff43a1030038262ce4.jpg)\\n![A one year old tomcat is playing in a cardboard box.]()\\n![A one year old tomcat is playing in a cardboard box.](https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/tiSoXEwocjypUre9-WwZbtv2h1g=/250x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/LawofEffect-8cb5a97f611e4c55940e07d1b1092cfb.jpg)\\n![An abstract image of a brain]()\\n![An abstract image of a brain](https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/jMG5G_uImTDq9m1UzrmavNfPqDA=/250x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cannonbard-d2a4a760320e4f03bf51b477a3612fa5.jpg)\\n![People on a roller coaster laugh and smile.]()\\n![People on a roller coaster laugh and smile.](https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/BvOP45FKwuHhza4dLufjxW4hWsI=/250x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jameslangeimage-ca6a980a9f194b058a79d6e76674a098.jpg)\\n![A male and female side silhouette positioned back to back, overlaid with various semi-transparent jigsaw puzzle shapes.]()\\n![A male and female side silhouette positioned back to back, overlaid with various semi-transparent jigsaw puzzle shapes.](https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/-zcr8oRcGRcNWs0t8ZhZ7hMaelA=/250x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Psychodynamictheory-5c783deac9e77c00011c8326.jpg)\\n![People putting together jigsaw puzzle]()\\n![People putting together jigsaw puzzle](https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/WDFlwgl6JyFM2BAe7QluY7wWTYQ=/250x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/SocialConstructionism-5c53d71f46e0fb00013a1fc0.jpg)\\n![Portrait of Ivan Pavlov]()\\n![Portrait of Ivan Pavlov](https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/Y6hsfqpUZa1kuNeI_w6sK0-avq4=/250x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pavlov-5b42e777c9e77c0037fb1a21.jpg)\\n![Two men and a woman are seated at a table.

Sternberg\\'s theory comprises three parts: componential, experiential and practical.\\n\\nSternberg\\'s theory has since been expanded and advanced in the book *Experiential Intelligence* by [Soren Kaplan](/wiki/Soren_Kaplan \"Soren Kaplan\").\\n\\n## Different components of information processing\\n\\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Schematic_illustrating_one_trial_of_each_stimulus_pool_in_the_Sternberg_task.jpg/250px-Schematic_illustrating_one_trial_of_each_stimulus_pool_in_the_Sternberg_task.jpg)\\n\\nSternberg associated the workings of the mind with a series of components. These components he labeled the metacomponents, performance components, and knowledge-acquisition components.[[4]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESternberg1985-4)\\n\\nThe *metacomponents* are executive processes used in [problem solving](/wiki/Problem_solving \"Problem solving\") and [decision making](/wiki/Decision_making \"Decision making\") that involve the majority of managing our mind. They tell the mind how to act. Metacomponents are also sometimes referred to as a [homunculus](/wiki/Homunculus \"Homunculus\"). A homunculus is a fictitious or metaphorical \"person\" inside our head that controls our actions, and which is often seen to invite an infinite regress of homunculi controlling each other.[[4]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESternberg1985-4)\\n\\nSternberg\\'s next set of components, *performance components*, are the processes that actually carry out the actions the metacomponents dictate. These are the basic processes that allow us to do tasks, such as perceiving problems in our long-term [memory](/wiki/Memory \"Memory\"), perceiving relations between objects, and applying relations to another set of terms.[[5]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESternberg1997-5)\\n\\nThe last set of components, *knowledge-acquisition components*, are used in obtaining new [information](/wiki/Information \"Information\"). These components complete tasks that involve selectively choosing relevant information from a mix of information, some of it relevant and some of it irrelevant. These components can also be used to selectively combine the various pieces of information they have gathered. Gifted individuals are proficient in using these components because they are able to learn new information at a greater rate.[[5]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESternberg1997-5)\\n\\nWhereas Sternberg explains that the basic information processing components underlying the three parts of his triarchic theory are the same, different contexts and different tasks require different kinds of intelligence.[[6]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESternberg_et_al.2001-6)\\n\\n### Componential – analytical subtheory\\n\\nThis form of intelligence focuses on academic proficiency.[[1]](#cite_note-:0-1)\\n\\nSternberg associated the componential subtheory with analytical [giftedness](/wiki/Giftedness \"Giftedness\"). This is one of three types of giftedness that Sternberg recognizes. Analytical giftedness is influential in being able to take apart problems and being able to see solutions not often seen. Unfortunately, individuals with only this type are not as adept at creating unique ideas of their own. This form of giftedness is the type that is tested most often.[[5]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESternberg1997-5)\\n\\n### Experiential – creative subtheory\\n\\nThis form of intelligence focuses on \"capacity to be intellectually flexible and innovative.[[1]](#cite_note-:0-1)\\n\\nThe experiential subtheory is the second stage of the triarchic theory. This stage deals mainly with how well a task is performed with regard to how familiar it is. Sternberg splits the role of experience into two parts: novelty and automation.\\n\\nA *novel* situation is one that has not been experienced before. People that are adept at managing a novel situation can take the task and find new ways of solving it that the majority of people would not notice.[[5]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESternberg1997-5)\\n\\nA process that has been *automated* has been performed multiple times and can now be done with little or no extra thought. Once a process is automatized, it can be run in parallel with the same or other processes. The problem with novelty and automation is that being skilled in one component does not ensure that you are skilled in the other.[[5]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESternberg1997-5)\\n\\nThe experiential subtheory also correlates with another one of Sternberg\\'s proposed types of giftedness. Synthetic giftedness is seen in [creativity](/wiki/Creativity \"Creativity\"), [intuition](/wiki/Intuition_(knowledge) \"Intuition (knowledge)\"), and a study of the [arts](/wiki/Arts \"Arts\"). People with synthetic giftedness are not often seen with the highest [IQs](/wiki/Intelligence_quotient \"Intelligence quotient\") because there are not currently any tests that can sufficiently measure these attributes, but synthetic giftedness is especially useful in creating new ideas to create and solve new problems. Sternberg also associated another one of his students, \"Barbara\", to the synthetic giftedness. Barbara did not perform as well as Alice on the tests taken to get into school, but was recommended to [Yale University](/wiki/Yale_University \"Yale University\") based on her exceptional creative and intuitive skills. Barbara was later very valuable in creating new ideas for research.[[5]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESternberg1997-5)\\n\\n### Practical – contextual subtheory\\n\\nSternberg\\'s third subtheory of intelligence, called practical or contextual, \"deals with the mental activity involved in attaining fit to [context](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/context \"wiktionary:context\")\".[[3]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESternberg198545-3) Through the three processes of adaptation, shaping, and selection, individuals create an ideal fit between themselves and their environment. This type of intelligence is often referred to as \"street smarts.\"\\n\\n*Adaptation* occurs when one makes a change within oneself in order to better adjust to one\\'s surroundings.[[4]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESternberg1985-4) For example, when the weather changes and temperatures drop, people adapt by wearing extra layers of clothing to remain warm.\\n\\n*Shaping* occurs when one changes their environment to better suit one\\'s needs.[[4]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESternberg1985-4) A teacher may invoke the new rule of raising hands to speak to ensure that the lesson is taught with least possible disruption.\\n\\nThe process of *selection* is undertaken when a completely new alternate environment is found to replace the previous, unsatisfying environment to meet the individual\\'s goals.[[4]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESternberg1985-4) For instance, immigrants leave their lives in their homeland countries where they endure economical and social hardships and go to other countries in search of a better and less strained life.\\n\\nThe effectiveness with which an individual fits to his or her environment and contends with daily situations reflects degree of intelligence. Sternberg\\'s third type of giftedness, called practical giftedness, involves the ability to apply synthetic and analytic skills to everyday situations. Practically gifted people are superb in their ability to succeed in any setting.[[5]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESternberg1997-5) An example of this type of giftedness is \"Celia\". Celia did not have outstanding analytical or synthetic abilities, but she \"was highly successful in figuring out what she needed to do in order to succeed in an academic environment. She knew what kind of research was valued, how to get articles into journals, how to impress people at job interviews, and the like\".[[7]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESternberg199744-7) Celia\\'s contextual intelligence allowed her to use these skills to her best advantage.\\n\\nSternberg also acknowledges that an individual is not restricted to having excellence in only one of these three intelligences. Many people may possess an integration of all three and have high levels of all three intelligences.\\n\\nPractical intelligence is also a topic covered by Canadian journalist [Malcolm Gladwell](/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell \"Malcolm Gladwell\") in his book *[Outliers: The Story of Success](/wiki/Outliers:_The_Story_of_Success \"Outliers: The Story of Success\")*.[[8]](#cite_note-8)\\n\\n## Criticism\\n\\nPsychologist [Linda Gottfredson](/wiki/Linda_Gottfredson \"Linda Gottfredson\") criticises the unempirical nature of triarchic theory. Further, she argues it is absurd to assert that traditional intelligence tests are not measuring practical intelligence, given that they show a moderate correlation with income, especially at middle age when individuals have had a chance to reach their maximum career potential, and an even higher correlation with occupational prestige, and that IQ tests predict the ability to stay out of jail and stay alive (all of which qualifies as practical intelligence or \"[street smarts](/wiki/Know-how \"Know-how\")\").[[9]](#cite_note-Gottfredson2003a-9)[[10]](#cite_note-Gottfredson2003b-10) Gottfredson claims that what Sternberg calls practical intelligence is not a broad aspect of cognition at all but simply a specific set of skills people learn to cope with a specific environment (task specific knowledge).\\n\\nThere is evidence to suggest that certain aspects of creativity (i.e. [divergent thinking](/wiki/Divergent_thinking \"Divergent thinking\")) are separable from analytical intelligence, and are better accounted for by the cognitive process of [executive functioning](/wiki/Executive_functioning \"Executive functioning\").[[11]](#cite_note-11) More specifically, [task-switching](/wiki/Task_switching_(psychology) \"Task switching (psychology)\") and interference management are suggested to play an important role in divergent thinking. A more recent [meta-analysis](/wiki/Meta-analysis \"Meta-analysis\") found only small correlations between IQ and creativity.[[12]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKim2005-12)\\n\\n## See also\\n\\n## References\\n\\n## Bibliography\\n\\n| * [v](/wiki/Template:Human_intelligence_topics \"Template:Human intelligence topics\") * [t](/wiki/Template_talk:Human_intelligence_topics \"Template talk:Human intelligence topics\") * [e](/wiki/Special:EditPage/Template:Human_intelligence_topics \"Special:EditPage/Template:Human intelligence topics\")  [Human intelligence](/wiki/Human_intelligence \"Human intelligence\") [topics](/wiki/Outline_of_human_intelligence \"Outline of human intelligence\") | |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Types | * [Collective](/wiki/Collective_intelligence \"Collective intelligence\") * [Emotional](/wiki/Emotional_intelligence \"Emotional intelligence\") * [Intellectual](/wiki/Intellectual_giftedness \"Intellectual giftedness\") * [Linguistic](/wiki/Linguistic_intelligence \"Linguistic intelligence\") * [Multiple](/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences \"Theory of multiple intelligences\") * [Social](/wiki/Social_intelligence \"Social intelligence\") * [Spatial](/wiki/Spatial_intelligence_(psychology) \"Spatial intelligence (psychology)\")\\xa0([visuospatial](/wiki/Spatial_visualization_ability \"Spatial visualization ability\")) |\\n| [Abilities](/wiki/Ability \"Ability\"), traits, and constructs | * [Cognition](/wiki/Cognition \"Cognition\") * [Cognitive liberty](/wiki/Cognitive_liberty \"Cognitive liberty\") * [Communication](/wiki/Communication \"Communication\") * [Creativity](/wiki/Creativity \"Creativity\") * [Fluid and crystallized intelligence](/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence \"Fluid and crystallized intelligence\") * [*g* factor](/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics) \"G factor (psychometrics)\") * [Intellect](/wiki/Intellect \"Intellect\") * [Intelligence quotient](/wiki/Intelligence_quotient \"Intelligence quotient\") * [Knowledge](/wiki/Knowledge \"Knowledge\") * [Learning](/wiki/Learning \"Learning\") * [Memory](/wiki/Memory \"Memory\") * [Problem solving](/wiki/Problem_solving \"Problem solving\") * [Reasoning](/wiki/Reason \"Reason\") * [Skill](/wiki/Skill \"Skill\") * [Thought](/wiki/Thought \"Thought\")\\xa0([abstraction](/wiki/Abstraction \"Abstraction\")) * [Understanding](/wiki/Understanding \"Understanding\") * [Visual processing](/wiki/Visual_system \"Visual system\") |\\n| Models and theories | * [Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory](/wiki/Cattell%E2%80%93Horn%E2%80%93Carroll_theory \"Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory\") * [Fluid and crystallized intelligence](/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence \"Fluid and crystallized intelligence\") * [Multiple-intelligences theory](/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences \"Theory of multiple intelligences\") * [PASS theory](/wiki/PASS_theory_of_intelligence \"PASS theory of intelligence\") * [Three-stratum theory](/wiki/Three-stratum_theory \"Three-stratum theory\") * Triarchic theory |\\n| Areas of research | * [Evolution of human intelligence](/wiki/Evolution_of_human_intelligence \"Evolution of human intelligence\") * [Heritability of IQ](/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ \"Heritability of IQ\") * [Psychometrics](/wiki/Psychometrics \"Psychometrics\") * [Intelligence and environment](/wiki/Environment_and_intelligence \"Environment and intelligence\")\\xa0/ [fertility](/wiki/Fertility_and_intelligence \"Fertility and intelligence\")\\xa0/ [height](/wiki/Height_and_intelligence \"Height and intelligence\")\\xa0/ [health](/wiki/Impact_of_health_on_intelligence \"Impact of health on intelligence\")\\xa0/ [longevity](/wiki/Cognitive_epidemiology \"Cognitive epidemiology\")\\xa0/ [neuroscience](/wiki/Neuroscience_and_intelligence \"Neuroscience and intelligence\")\\xa0/ [personality](/wiki/Intelligence_and_personality \"Intelligence and personality\")\\xa0/ [race](/wiki/Race_and_intelligence \"Race and intelligence\")\\xa0/ [sex](/wiki/Sex_differences_in_intelligence \"Sex differences in intelligence\") |\\n| * [Outline of human intelligence](/wiki/Outline_of_human_intelligence \"Outline of human intelligence\")\\xa0/ [thought](/wiki/Outline_of_thought \"Outline of thought\") | |\\n\\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Global_thinking.svg/20px-Global_thinking.svg.png)\\n![](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1&usesul3=1)\\n![Wikimedia Foundation](/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg)\\n![Powered by MediaWiki](/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg)'},\n",

Although having useful knowledge and skills does contribute to a person’s intelligence, psychologist Howard Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences suggests that there’s more to being intelligent than simply being good at maths and English or learning a second language.\\n\\nAt our schools, we deliver a curriculum where children can develop these nine types of intelligence and learn their strengths and weaknesses, helping them understand their place in the world and decide which career they would like to pursue. In this blog, we will discuss the nine types of intelligence listed in Gardner’s research in more detail, and list the characteristics of each to help people understand which of the nine types of intelligence they possess.\\n\\n## What is the Multiple Intelligence (MI) Theory?\\n\\nHoward Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences proposes that humans are not born with all the intelligence they will ever have, and that everyone processes information in different ways. In other words, we continually learn and develop in different ways throughout our lives, even after we finish formal education.\\xa0\\xa0  \\n  \\n Gardner does not define intelligence as one single, general ability, but instead he divides it into nine different intelligences. While someone might be particularly strong in one area, such mathematical intelligence, they will actually possess a range of abilities across several intelligence types.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n## What are the nine types of intelligence?\\n\\nHoward Gardner’s nine types of intelligence include:\\xa0\\n\\n### 1. Logical-Mathematical Intelligence\\n\\nPerhaps the most obvious of the nine types of intelligence, logical-mathematical intelligence refers to someone’s ability to solve mathematical problems, spot trends and patterns, and understand relationships. If someone possesses logical-mathematical intelligence it means that order and sequencing feature greatly in their thinking process and they can think conceptually and abstractly.\\n\\n**You have high logical-mathematical intelligence if:**\\n\\n### 2. Linguistic Intelligence\\n\\n### 3. Interpersonal Intelligence\\n\\nInterpersonal intelligence or emotional intelligence refers to the link between intelligence and emotions. Someone with interpersonal intelligence is good at sensing other people’s emotions and reading their motives, this can be linked to both verbal and non-verbal communication skills.\\xa0  \\n \\xa0  \\n**You have high interpersonal intelligence if:**\\n\\n### 4. Intrapersonal Intelligence\\n\\n### 5. Musical Intelligence\\n\\nMusical intelligence is the most self-explanatory of the nine types of intelligence, it refers to someone’s ability to sense rhythm and sound and use this to create music.\\xa0  \\n \\xa0  \\n**You have a high level of musical intelligence if:**\\n\\n### 6. Visual-Spatial Intelligence\\n\\nVisual-spatial intelligence refers to people’s ability to view or visualise the world in its three dimensions. When discussing visualising the world in 3D, it involves the following capabilities:\\xa0  \\n \\xa0  \\n**Mental imagery** – being able to draw up an image or picture without an external stimulus, drawing from memories or previous experience. In other words, the detail of someone’s imagination.\\xa0  \\n \\xa0  \\n**Spatial reasoning** – being able to think about objects in 3D and draw generalisations despite having limited information. Mention a pyramid, and people with visual-spatial intelligence will be able to visualise how that pyramid will look from the front or the top.\\xa0  \\n \\xa0  \\n**Image manipulation** – being able to visualise changes to an image before they have been implemented. For example, an artist visualising how their picture will look before they have drawn it.\\xa0  \\n \\xa0  \\n**Artistic skills** – being able to create artwork, this also includes graphic skills.\\xa0  \\n \\xa0  \\n Visual-spatial intelligence and creativity work hand-in-hand, drawing on an active imagination to produce impressive visual work.\\xa0  \\n \\xa0  \\n**You have high visual-spatial intelligence if:**\\n\\n### 7. Bodily-Kinaesthetic Intelligence\\n\\nBodily-kinaesthetic intelligence refers to mind and body co-ordination and is very important in athletes. Athletic ability isn’t often referred to as intelligence, but kinaesthetic intelligence is measured on someone’s ability to use their physicality to manipulate objects and other elements around them.\\xa0  \\n \\xa0  \\n**You have high bodily-kinaesthetic intelligence if:**\\n\\n[Extra-curricular](/pbis-prague/outstanding-experiences/extracurricular-activities) and sports activities are a fantastic way of improving your bodily-kinaesthetic intelligence. These activities not only provide a space to develop practical sport skills, but also develop important social skills and generally boost academic performance.\\xa0  \\n  \\n Great careers for people with bodily-kinaesthetic intelligence include physical therapist, dancer, athlete, coach, fitness instructor, gym owner, actor, mechanic or carpenter.\\n\\n### 8. Naturalist Intelligence\\n\\nNaturalist intelligence refers to the ability to read and understand nature. Having sensitivity to the non-living elements of all living things is considered “nature smart”.\\xa0  \\n \\xa0  \\n**You have high naturalist intelligence if:**\\n\\n### 9. Existential Intelligence\\n\\nExistential intelligence refers to deep sensitivity and people’s ability to handle deep questions such as the meaning of existence, it’s one of the most complex of the nine types of intelligence listed in Gardner’s research. People with existential intelligence are not only comfortable talking about these serious questions but also strive to find the answer.\\xa0  \\n \\xa0  \\n**You have high existential intelligence if:**\\n\\nThis article should help you better understand the nine types of intelligence and where your own strengths and weaknesses lie.

Is it their ability to ace tests or crunch numbers? Psychologist**Robert J. Sternberg** sees intelligence not as a narrow, monolithic quality that makes you good at chess or getting top grades, but as an interplay between the analytical, practical and creative aspects of your mind. He calls this **“the Triarchic theory of intelligence.”**\\n\\n**Analytical intelligence** is what you probably imagine it is – the pure brain power with which you process information. It is invoked when you need to analyze something or solve problems. This is the type of braininess measured by IQ tests, which in Sternberg’s view are woefully inadequate in determining someone’s overall intelligence as they focus only on the analytical side.\\n\\n**Creative intelligence** comes into play when people need to think creatively and adjust effectively to new situations. This kind of intelligence is also responsible for synthesizing information and gaining insights. Another way to think about this is having the ability to use the knowledge and skills you already have to manage novel or unusual situations.\\n\\n**Practical intelligence** involves the ability to deal with daily tasks in the real world. You can call it “street smarts” that show how well a person relates to the external environment. It is also directed towards goals which seek to adapt to or transform the world around you. “Intelligent behavior involves adapting to your environment, changing your environment, or selecting a better environment,” wrote Sternberg.\\xa0\\n\\nWhen you measure this type of intelligence, you are looking not just for mental prowess, but factors such as emotion and attitude that also influence how well the person makes decisions. A leader, who has a strong ability to understand and motivate people as well as to delegate responsibility to the right individuals would score high in practical smarts.\\xa0\\n\\nAn important aspect of practical intelligence is the ability to learn. To gain knowledge, it’s not enough to have experiences, but to glean from them the key information that can be adapted in other situations.\\n\\n[Sternberg](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiR1dLUjMjUAhUB-WMKHYOBBmQQFgg7MAI&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.robertjsternberg.com%2F&usg=AFQjCNFImZJzXsAkkpkPKsrdRM0jG6OpBA&sig2=-P6c8fvtID_JWCkIhy5eTA), who is a professor at Cornell University, sees an intelligent person as someone who can find the right balance between the different mental abilities while they solve problems they encounter. Sternberg also believes that it’s possible to excel in more than one type of intelligence. Many people use all three at a high level. This can often be the reason for their success in life.\\n\\n[In an interview](http://www.indiana.edu/~video/stream/launchflash.html?format=mp4&folder=iat&filename=sternberg1_def.mp4), Sternberg points out that people who reach success are usually the ones who “found something they do really well”. And that area of excellence can really vary from person to person. It’s also important, according to Sternberg, to identify what you don’t do so well and find help to make up for those deficiencies.\\n\\n[Here’s how](http://www.indiana.edu/~video/stream/launchflash.html?format=mp4&folder=iat&filename=sternberg1_def.mp4) Sternberg explains his views on intelligence:\\n\\n> I prefer to refer to it as “successful intelligence.” And the reason is that the emphasis is on the use of your intelligence to achieve success in your life. \\xa0 So I define it as your skill in achieving whatever it is you want to attain in your life within your sociocultural context. Meaning that people have different goals for themselves, and for some it’s to get very good grades in school and to do well on tests, and for others it might be to become a very good basketball player or actress or musician. So, it’s your skill in obtaining what you want in life within your sociocultural context [which] means that if you want to be an axe murderer it wouldn’t count–by capitalizing on your strengths and compensating for, or correcting, your weaknesses.\\n\\nWhile adapting to weaknesses is one smart thing to do, another is to know when to quit. Sternberg points out that to be “successfully intelligent means knowing when you’re in the wrong place at the wrong time – the wrong job, the wrong relationship, the wrong place to live.”\\n\\nIt’s also worth noting that being considered intelligent in one culture does not necessarily mean you’re intelligent in another, according to Sternberg. Whatever your circumstances, you just have to find the best place and activity for you to maximize your abilities.\\n\\nInitially driven by his distaste for tests in developing a broader model of intelligence, Sternberg developed his own measure of how a person uses intelligence under his model. Check out a study on the effectiveness of [the Sternberg Triarchic Abilities Test (STAT)](http://www.mdpi.com/2079-3200/2/3/56).
