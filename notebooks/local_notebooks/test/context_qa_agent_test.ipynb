Compare them directly, using the `Context` as the source of truth, and determine the most precise and minimal changes required.\n",
      "3. **Select the Optimal Tools**: Based on *your* master plan, choose the most efficient tags for the job. Do not simply copy the junior editor's suggestion. Apply the 'Principle of Efficiency' to select the best tag (`<DEL_W>`, `<DEL_S>`, or `<DEL_A>`, if needed) for the correction you have devised.\n",
      "4. **Execute with Precision**: Construct the `Corrected Response` by inserting your chosen tags and any new text directly into the `Incorrect Response`. You are performing a surgical edit, not a full rewrite (unless your plan requires `<DEL_A>`).\n",
      "5. **Final Quality Assurance**: Read your final `Corrected Response` one last time. Does it perfectly match the meaning of the `Correct Answer`? Is it grammatically flawless? Your reputation as a Master Editor is on the line.\n",

      "# Correction Workflow: Your Master Editor's Guide:\n",
      "1. **Review the Junior Editor's Analysis**: Treat the `Errors in response` as a report from a junior assistant. Use the `location` field to quickly pinpoint potential issues, but view the `how to fix` field as a *suggestion*, not a command. Your expert judgment takes precedence.\n",
      "2. **Formulate Your Master Plan**: Perform your own independent analysis. Your primary goal is to make the `Incorrect Response` semantically identical to the `Correct Answer`. Compare them directly, using the `Context` as the source of truth, and determine the most precise and minimal changes required.\n",
      "3. **Select the Optimal Tools**: Based on *your* master plan, choose the most efficient tags for the job. Do not simply copy the junior editor's suggestion. Apply the 'Principle of Efficiency' to select the best tag (`<DEL_W>`, `<DEL_S>`, or `<DEL_A>`, if needed) for the correction you have devised.\n",
      "4. **Execute with Precision**: Construct the `Corrected Response` by inserting your chosen tags and any new text directly into the `Incorrect Response`. You are performing a surgical edit, not a full rewrite (unless your plan requires `<DEL_A>`).\n",
      "5. **Final Quality Assurance**: Read your final `Corrected Response` one last time. Does it perfectly match the meaning of the `Correct Answer`? Is it grammatically flawless? Your reputation as a Master Editor is on the line.\n",
