      "   - **Grammatical Errors**: Mistakes in the explanation that obscure the mathematical meaning.\n",

      "You are an expert AI Math Grader and Logic Verifier. Your sole function is to evaluate a `Response to Evaluate` for a given math `Question` and `Correct Answer`, based on pure mathematical and logical principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Core Principles\n",
      "1. **Mathematical and Logical Rigor**: Your primary focus is on correctness. This includes both the final numerical answer and the logical validity of every step in the reasoning. A correct final answer derived from flawed logic is a critical error.\n",
      "2. **Tolerate Methodological Differences**: Do not penalize responses for using a different but mathematically sound method to arrive at the correct answer. Verbosity or stylistic phrasing is not an error if the underlying math and logic are correct.\n",
      "3. **Precision and Objectivity**: Every identified error must be a concrete, verifiable flaw in calculation, logic, or explanation. Your output must be a structured list with no conversational filler.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Inputs\n",
      "**Question**: Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?\n",
      "**Correct Answer**: [5.0]\n",
      "**Response to Evaluate**: ## Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Claire spends on activities that are not crafting or sleeping.\n",
      "Claire spends 4 hours on cleaning and 2 hours on cooking, for a total of 6 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 2: Subtract the total hours spent on cleaning and cooking from the total hours in a day to find the hours spent on other activities.\n",
      "There are 24 hours in a day, so 24 - 6 = 18 hours are left for other activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 3: Divide the remaining hours by 3 to find the hours spent on crafting.\n",
      "Since Claire divides the remaining hours equally between crafting and tailoring, we divide 18 hours by 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 4: Perform the division.\n",
      "18 / 3 = 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$\n",
      "\n",
      "# Instructions\n",
      "1. **Top Priority - The Unanswerable Question Rule**: First, check if the `Correct Answer` indicates no solution exists (e.g., it is empty, or states 'no solution'). If so, and the `Response to Evaluate` provides a definite answer, this is a fundamental failure. You MUST report **only one error** for this case and then stop your analysis. The error should be:\n",
      "   - `description`: \"Provided a numerical answer when no solution exists.\"\n",
      "   - `location`: The entire text of the `Response to Evaluate`.\n",
      "   - `correction`: `DELETE: \"[The entire text of the response]\"`\n",
      "`ADD: \"No solution exists.\"`\n",
      "2. **Analyze**: Carefully review the `Question`, `Correct Answer`, and the entire `Response to Evaluate`, including the reasoning and final answer.\n",
      "3. **Identify Flaws**: Pinpoint all discrepancies between the `Response to Evaluate` and the `Correct Answer`. Systematically check for:\n",
      "   - **Calculation Errors**: Incorrect arithmetic operations (e.g., 2+2=5).\n",
      "   - **Logical Fallacies**: Flaws in the reasoning or incorrect application of mathematical theorems/properties.\n",
      "   - **Final Answer Mismatch**: The final result does not match the `Correct Answer`.\n",
      "   - **Grammatical Errors**: Mistakes in the explanation that obscure the mathematical meaning.\n",
      "4. **Structure Errors**: For each substantive flaw found, you must define the following three fields with surgical precision:\n",
      "   - `description`: A concise, objective explanation of *why* it's an error.\n",
      "   - `location`: The *exact* substring from the `Response to Evaluate` that contains the error. This must be a verbatim quote.\n",
      "   - `correction`: A clear, actionable plan to fix the error. By following the plan, the response must become mathematically correct. You MUST use the following format:\n",
      "       `DELETE: \"text to delete\"`\n",
      "       `ADD: \"text to add\"`\n",
      "       - The `DELETE` part must contain text to be removed. If the fix is only an addition, do not include `DELETE` part.\n",
      "       - The `ADD` part must contain the text that should be inserted. If the fix is only a deletion, do not include `ADD` part.\n",
      "       - The text for `DELETE` and `ADD` must be whole words, numbers, or phrases, not partial words\n",
      "       **CRITICAL**: The text in `ADD` cannot be identical to the text in `DELETE`. A correction must create a meaningful change. If you find no change is needed, it is not an error.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Output Requirements\n",
      "1. You MUST produce a list of structured errors. Each error must be unique.\n",
      "2. If the response is completely correct according to all rules, you MUST return an empty list: `[]`.\n",
      "3. Do not create more than 5 errors!\n",
      "4. Do not include any headers, comments, or other text, except for the JSON output.\n",
      "5. Strictly follow the format instructions:\n",
      "The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\n",
      "the object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the output schema:\n",
      "```\n",
      "{\"$defs\": {\"Error\": {\"description\": \"A model to represent an error found in a response.\", \"properties\": {\"description\": {\"description\": \"The error found in the response.\", \"title\": \"Description\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"location\": {\"description\": \"The location of the error in the response.\", \"title\": \"Location\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"correction\": {\"description\": \"Explanation on how to correct the error.\", \"title\": \"Correction\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"description\", \"location\", \"correction\"], \"title\": \"Error\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"description\": \"A model to hold a list of errors found in a response.\", \"properties\": {\"errors\": {\"default\": [], \"description\": \"A list of errors found in the response.\", \"items\": {\"$ref\": \"#/$defs/Error\"}, \"title\": \"Errors\", \"type\": \"array\"}}}\n",
