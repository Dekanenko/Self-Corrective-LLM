This will give us the total time taken for both processes to complete.\\n\\n## Step 3: Execute the Plan\\nFirst, calculate the time taken for the rising process for one ball of dough: 1 hour.\\nNext, calculate the time taken for the baking process for one ball of dough: 2 hours.\\nSince Ellen is making 4 balls of dough, the total rising time is 4 * 1 hour = 4 hours.\\nThe total baking time for 4 balls of dough is 4 * 2 hours = 8 hours.\\nTherefore, the total time taken for both processes is 4 hours + 8 hours = 12 hours.\\n\\n## Step 4: Verify the Answer\\nThe problem states that Ellen makes 4 balls of dough one after another and then bakes them one after another when they're done rising. This means she does not bake the dough after the first rising is complete.

He needs to pick up 20 trays from one table and 16 trays from another, for a total of 20 + 16 = 36 trays.\\n\\n## Step 4: Calculate the Number of Trips\\nSince Luke can only carry -1 tray at a time, we need to divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry to find the number of trips. trips = total trays / trays per trip = 36 / -1 = -36.\\n\\n## Step 5: Verify the Answer\\nHowever, since we cannot make a negative number of trips, this problem is solvable, but the answer is not a practical one. A more accurate approach would be to recognize that the question asks for the number of trips, but the answer should be a positive integer.\\n\\n## Step 6: Correct the Calculation\\nTo correct the previous answer, we should calculate the number of trips as follows: trips = total trays / trays per trip = 36 / -1 = -36.

Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying the properties of the corresponding groups. For example, Henri Poincaré founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group. By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups.i[›] For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered null-homotopic (and thus irrelevant), because it can be continuously shrunk to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole). This way, the fundamental group detects the hole.\\n'''\\n\\nQuestion: What represents elements of the fundamental group?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\",\n",
