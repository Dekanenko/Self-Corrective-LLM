Multiple art galleries exist in the city, notably in the downtown area and around the University of Michigan campus. Aside from a large restaurant scene in the Main Street, South State Street, and South University Avenue areas, Ann Arbor ranks first among U.S. cities in the number of booksellers and books sold per capita. The Ann Arbor District Library maintains four branch outlets in addition to its main downtown building. The city is also home to the Gerald R.

       "   \"## Step 1: Calculate the total number of trays that need to be picked up.\\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of trays that Luke needs to pick up. He has to pick up 20 trays from one table and 16 trays from another.\\n\\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of trips needed for the first table.\\nSince Luke can only carry -1 tray at a time, the number of trips to pick up 20 trays can be calculated by dividing 20 by -1, which gives us -20. This means he would have to make 20 trips to pick up 20 trays.\\n\\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of trips needed for the second table.\\nSimilarly, for the second table, we divide 16 by -1, which gives us -16. This means he would have to make 16 trips to pick up 16 trays.\\n\\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of trips needed.\\nTo find the total number of trips Luke needs to make, we add the number of trips for the first table and the second table, which is -20 + (-16) = -36.\\n\\n## Step 5: Consider the negative trips.\\nSince Luke can only make a positive number of trips, and he cannot make a negative number of trips, we have to consider that the total number of trips is -36. However, we need to account for the fact that he cannot carry a negative number of trays.\\n\\n## Step 6: Correct the calculation to account for the fact that Luke can only carry a positive number of trays.\\nTo correct the calculation, we should have simply added the number of trips for each table and considered the direction of the trip. Since Luke can only make -1 trips, the correct calculation should be 20 + 16 = 36, but since we cannot have negative trips, we need to reconsider our approach.\\n\\n## Step 7: Reconsider the approach for calculating the total trips.\\nLet's re-evaluate our approach. We can think of this problem as the number of positive integers that Luke can make with 36 trips, since he can carry a negative number of trays. However, the problem is asking for the total number of trips, not the number of positive integers.\\n\\n## Step 8: Correctly calculate the number of trips by considering the number of positive integers.\\nWe need to find the largest number of positive integers that can be made with 36 trips.

We need to re-calculate the number of trips by considering that Luke must pick up all the trays from the first table and then some from the second table. However, he can't pick up a negative number of trays, so we should reconsider the approach.\\n\\n## Step 5:  Re-calculate the number of trips by dividing the number of trays from each table by the number of trays he can carry per trip, and then adding these two results together.\\nWe need to pick up 20 trays from the first table and 16 trays from the second table. To find the number of trips from the first table, we divide 20 by -1, which results in 20 trips. To find the number of trips from the second table, we divide 16 by -1, which also results in 16 trips. Since we cannot have a negative number of trips, we must re-examine the problem.\\n\\n## Step 6:  Re-evaluate the problem statement and the answer we obtained in Step 5.\\nWe find that our initial calculation was incorrect. Luke can pick up a positive number of trays per trip. To solve this problem correctly, we need to re-calculate the number of trips by considering the number of trays he needs to pick up from each table.\\n\\n## Step 7:  We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of trays Luke needs to pick up from each table to determine the minimum number of trips he needs to make.\\nWe find that the GCD of 20 and 16 is 4.\\n\\n## Step 8:  We use\",\n",

This is because he needs to carry the trays in reverse order, starting from the table with 20 trays and ending at the table with 16 trays.\\n\\n## Step 3: Perform the division to calculate the number of trips.\\nTo find the number of trips, we divide the total number of trays (36) by the number of trays he can carry (-1): 36 ÷ -1 = -36.\\n\\n## Step 4: Determine if the number of trips can be negative.\\nSince we cannot have a negative number of trips, we must conclude that the problem cannot be solved.
