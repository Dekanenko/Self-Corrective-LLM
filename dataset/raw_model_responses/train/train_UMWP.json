This simplifies to rate = 1 liter / 3 hours.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the amount of fuel consumed in 90 hours\nTo find the total amount of fuel consumed in 90 hours, we multiply the rate of fuel consumption per hour by the number of hours: total fuel consumed = rate * hours = (1 liter / 3 hours) * 90 hours.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the calculation\nPerforming the calculation, we get total fuel consumed = (1 liter / 3 hours) * 90 hours = 30 liters.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$",

The proportion is 7 liters / 21 hours = x / 90 hours.\n\n## Step 4: Cross-multiply\nTo solve the proportion, we can cross-multiply: 7 * 90 = 21 * x.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the product\nThe product of 7 * 90 is 630.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the value of x\nTo find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 21: x = 630 / 21.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the final value of x\nx = 30.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$",
